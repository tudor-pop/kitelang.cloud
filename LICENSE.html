    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Licensing</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: Can I use Kite for free in my startup?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: Yes! As long as your company has fewer than 100 employees AND less than $1 million in annual revenue, you can use Kite freely for commercial purposes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: My company just reached 100 employees. What should I do?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: Congratulations on your growth! Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@kitelang.cloud">support@kitelang.cloud</a> to discuss commercial licensing options. We offer flexible plans for growing companies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: Can I use Kite in my open-source project?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: Absolutely! Kite is free for open-source projects, provided they maintain a compatible license.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: What counts as "hosting Kite as a service"?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: This means providing Kite infrastructure/execution as a managed service to external customers (like a SaaS offering). Using Kite internally to manage your own infrastructure is always allowed under the free license for companies under 100 employees AND under $1M in annual revenue.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: Can consultants use Kite for client projects?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: Yes! Consultants can use Kite to build infrastructure for clients. The client's company size determines whether they need a commercial license, not the consultant's.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: What if my non-profit has over 100 people?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: Non-profit organizations can use Kite for free regardless of size. Contact us if you need confirmation or documentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: How do you verify company size?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: We operate on a trust-based system. We only verify company size if there's a specific inquiry or if we suspect license violation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: What if my company has 150 employees but only $500K revenue?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: You would need a paid license. A commercial license is required if your company has 100+ employees OR $1M+ revenue. You must stay below BOTH thresholds to use the free license.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Q: Can I contribute to Kite's development?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer">A: Yes! We welcome contributions. By contributing, you agree to our Contributor License Agreement, which allows us to use your contributions in the project.</p>
