help me generate detailed style guide from docs.html.
You should include the following:
- overview
- color palette
- typography
- spacing system
- component styles
- shadows and elevations
- animations and transitions
- border radius
- grid
- layout
- media queries
- etc.

In a word, a detailed analysis and description of the project style system, and don't miss any important details.
